# The luqmn blog

Howdy! I am [luqmn](https://github.com/theluqmn), a 15 year old software developer, business analyst, tech enthusiast and student. I wrote this blog to share the knowledge and ideas that god has bestowed upon me, for others to learn from, discover and make use of. Yes, the **entire thing is written using markdown**. No HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript, because I am yet to learn frontend development.
