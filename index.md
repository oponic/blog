# The luqmn blog

Howdy! I am [Luqman](https://github.com/theluqmn) (also goes by **luq**), a 15 year old software developer, business analyst, tech enthusiast and student. I wrote this blog to share the knowledge and ideas that god has bestowed upon me, for others to learn from, discover and make use of. Yes, the **entire thing is written using markdown**. No HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript, because I am yet to learn frontend development.

Have any suggestions or feedback? Reach me on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/theluqmn) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/theluqmn). All contents, assets and sources on my blog are open-source, and can be accessed on the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/theluqmn/blog)!
